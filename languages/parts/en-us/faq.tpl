					<p>On Wouaf IT, an event is called a Wouaf.</p>
					<p>You can add as many Wouafs as you like, the procedure is very simple:</p>
					<p>First, create your account on Wouaf IT from
						<a href="/login/" data-href="login" data-show="modal" data-target="#modalWindow">the login page</a>.</p>
					<p>Two types of accounts are available: If you have a Facebook account, click the blue "Login with Facebook" button
						and enter your login information in the Facebook window that opened.
						Alternatively, you can create a Wouaf IT account by clicking on the green button "New Wouaffer? Create your profile!"
						and then, enter your credentials.</p>
					<p>Once you have created your account, you can create a Wouaf by clicking on the <i class="fa fa-plus-circle"></i> icon at
						the bottom right of the map. First place the map at the location of your event and click "OK".
						A page will then open which will allow you to fill in all the information of your event.</p>

					<p>We regularly import a number of content sources available on the Internet
						including public events published on the pages of Facebook.
						<br />
						If you are the administrator of one of these pages, you can regain control of your events by following these steps:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Log in to Wouaf IT using your Facebook account (button "Login with Facebook" on the
							<a href="/login/" data-href="login" data-show="modal" data-target="#modalWindow">login page</a>)</li>
						<li>Be careful to autorise Wouaf IT to access your Facebook pages and events during the first connection.</li>
						<li>Once logged in, go to your profile and click the button "Your Facebook events".</li>
						<li>On the page that opens, click "Import events from your pages".</li>
						<li>This will take a few minutes and once completed, you will receive an email.</li>
						<li>During this import operation, Wouaf IT also associate your Facebook events previously imported to your account,
							so you can easily manage them.</li>
					</ol>

					<p>If this does not meet your need (if your Facebook account is a personal account but it is attached to a separate pro page or multiple pages),
						we unfortunately do not yet have an automatic way to import your Facebook events to a "pro" account or several separate accounts on Wouaf IT.</p>

					<p>However, you can create one or more classic Wouaf IT accounts with the names and email addresses of your companies and enter
						your events directly into Wouaf IT.</p>

				<div class="card-block">
					<p>The idea behind Wouaf IT dates back to 2012, during a drive in the countryside with family.
						We crossed a stray dog on the road. It seemed visibly lost and ran away when we wanted to approach him.
						We thought that perhaps his owner was only a few minutes away looking for him but we had no easy way to warn him.
						<br />
						It is from this story that born the idea behind Wouaf IT: Providing a service that allows everyone
						to be able to tell people geographically close "Hey! Here there is something happening now".
						<br />
						This idea took time to mature to become the current site after several months of development.
						So we named "Wouaf" a publication on the site in reference to this dog, which hopefully, found his owner.
