	<p>Imagine a location-based source of information where everyone can report local events. From the neighborhood protest
		to the sale of your sofa via the lost dog of your neighbor.</p>
	
	<p>Contributive sources of information have already shown their quality and completeness. Wikipedia, Twitter, Facebook,
		Reddit and others are irreplaceable to inform us.</p>

	<p>Wouaf IT wants to highlight public events that are rare and hard to find around you. These events have little or
		no marketing budget and are rarely known outside the inner circle of the organizer. If the public knows there
		is something he will enjoy it every day.</p>

	<p>Some examples of what you can find and publish on Wouaf IT:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Communicate on a theme party.</li>
		<li>Sell a good.</li>
